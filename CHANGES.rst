Lupa change log
===============

2.1 (2023-??-??)
----------------

* GH#248: The LuaRuntime methods "eval", "execute" and "compile" gained new
  keyword options ``mode`` and ``name`` that allow constraining the input type
  and modifying the (chunk) name shown in error messages, following similar
  arguments in the Lua ``load()`` function.
  See https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html#pdf-load

* GH#246: Loading Lua modules did not work for the version specific Lua modules
  introduced in Lupa 2.0.  It turned out that it can only be enabled for
  one of them in a given Python run, so it is now left to users to enable it
  explicitly at need.
  (original patch by Richard Connon)

* The bundled Lua 5.1 was updated to 5.1.5 and Lua 5.2 to 5.2.4.
  (patch by xxyzz)

* Built with Cython 3.0.8 for improved support of Python 3.12.


2.0 (2023-04-03)
----------------

* GH#217: Lua stack traces in Python exception messages are now reversed to
  match the order of Python stack traces.

* GH#196: Lupa now ships separate extension modules built with Lua 5.3,
  Lua 5.4, LuaJIT 2.0 and LuaJIT 2.1 beta.  Note that this is build specific
  and may depend on the platform.  A normal Python import cascade can be used.

* GH#211: A new option `max_memory` allows to limit the memory usage of Lua code.
  (patch by Leo Developer)

* GH#171: Python references in Lua are now more safely reference counted
  to prevent garbage collection glitches.
  (patch by Guilherme Dantas)

* GH#146: Lua integers in Lua 5.3+ are converted from and to Python integers.
  (patch by Guilherme Dantas)

* GH#180: The ``python.enumerate()`` function now returns indices as integers
  if supported by Lua.
  (patch by Guilherme Dantas)

* GH#178: The Lua integer limits can be read from the module as
  ``LUA_MAXINTEGER`` and ``LUA_MININTEGER``.
  (patch by Guilherme Dantas)

* GH#174: Failures while calling the ``__index`` method in Lua during a
  table index lookup from Python could crash Python.
  (patch by Guilherme Dantas)

* GH#137: Passing ``None`` as a dict key into ``table_from()`` crashed.
  (patch by Leo Developer)

* GH#176: A new function ``python.args(*args, **kwargs)`` was added
  to help with building Python argument tuples and keyword argument dicts
  for Python function calls from Lua code.

* GH#177: Tables that are not sequences raise ``IndexError`` when unpacking
  them.  Previously, non-sequential items were simply ignored.

* GH#179: Resolve some C compiler warnings about signed/unsigned comparisons.
  (patch by Guilherme Dantas)

* Built with Cython 0.29.34.

* new helper method ``LuaRuntime.table_from(...)`` that creates a Lua
  table from one or more Python mappings and/or sequences

* new ``lupa.unpacks_lua_table`` and ``lupa.unpacks_lua_table_method``
  decorators to allow calling Python functions from Lua using named
  arguments

* fix a hang on shutdown where the LuaRuntime failed to deallocate due

* Lupa now plays more nicely with other Lua extensions that create
  userdata objects


1.0.1 (2014-10-11)
------------------

* fix a crash when requesting attributes of wrapped Lua coroutine objects

* looking up attributes on Lua objects that do not support it now always
  raises an AttributeError instead of sometimes raising a TypeError depending
  on the attribute name


1.0 (2014-09-28)
----------------

* NOTE: this release includes the major backwards incompatible changes listed
  below.  It is believed that they simplify the interaction between Python code
  and Lua code by more strongly following idiomatic Lua on the Lua side.

  * Instead of passing a wrapped ``python.none`` object into Lua, ``None``
    return values are now mapped to ``nil``, making them more straight forward
    to handle in Lua code.  This makes the behaviour more consistent, as it
    was previously somewhat arbitrary where ``none`` could appear and where a
    ``nil`` value was used.  The only remaining exception is during iteration,
    where the first returned value must not be ``nil`` in Lua, or otherwise
    the loop terminates prematurely.  To prevent this, any ``None`` value
    that the iterator returns, or any first item in exploded tuples that is
    ``None``, is still mapped to ``python.none``. Any further values
    returned in the same iteration will be mapped to ``nil`` if they are
    ``None``, not to ``none``.  This means that only the first argument
    needs to be manually checked for this special case.  For the
    ``enumerate()`` iterator, the counter is never ``None`` and thus the
    following unpacked items will never be mapped to ``python.none``.

  * When ``unpack_returned_tuples=True``, iteration now also unpacks tuple
    values, including ``enumerate()`` iteration, which yields a flat sequence
    of counter and unpacked values.

  * When calling bound Python methods from Lua as "obj:meth()", Lupa now
    prevents Python from prepending the self argument a second time, so that
    the Python method is now called as "obj.meth()".  Previously, it was called
    as "obj.meth(obj)".  Note that this can be undesired when the object itself
    is explicitly passed as first argument from Lua, e.g. when calling
    "func(obj)" where "func" is "obj.meth", but these constellations should be
    rare.  As a work-around for this case, user code can wrap the bound method
    in another function so that the final call comes from Python.

* garbage collection works for reference cycles that span both runtimes,
  Python and Lua

* calling from Python into Lua and back into Python did not clean up the
  Lua call arguments before the innermost call, so that they could leak
  into the nested Python call or its return arguments

* support for Lua 5.2 (in addition to Lua 5.1 and LuaJIT 2.0)

* Lua tables support Python's "del" statement for item deletion
  (patch by Jason Fried)

* Attribute lookup can use a more fine-grained control mechanism by
  implementing explicit getter and setter functions for a LuaRuntime
  (``attribute_handlers`` argument).  Patch by Brian Moe.

* item assignments/lookups on Lua objects from Python no longer
  special case double underscore names (as opposed to attribute lookups)


0.21 (2014-02-12)
-----------------

* some garbage collection issues were cleaned up using new Cython features

* new ``LuaRuntime`` option ``unpack_returned_tuples`` which automatically
  unpacks tuples returned from Python functions into separate Lua objects
  (instead of returning a single Python tuple object)

* some internal wrapper classes were removed from the module API

* Windows build fixes

* Py3.x build fixes

* support for building with Lua 5.1 instead of LuaJIT (setup.py --no-luajit)

  ``--with-cython`` to explicitly request a rebuild)

* requires Cython 0.20+ when building from unreleased sources

* built with Cython 0.20.1

  code

-----------------

* fix serious resource leak when creating multiple LuaRuntime instances

* portability fix for binary module importing


0.18 (2010-11-06)
-----------------

* fix iteration by returning ``Py_None`` object for ``None`` instead
  of ``nil``, which would terminate the iteration

* when converting Python values to Lua, represent ``None`` as a
  ``Py_None`` object in places where ``nil`` has a special meaning,
  but leave it as ``nil`` where it doesn't hurt

* support for counter start value in ``python.enumerate()``

* native implementation for ``python.enumerate()`` that is several
  times faster

* much faster Lua iteration over Python objects


0.17 (2010-11-05)
-----------------

* new helper function ``python.enumerate()`` in Lua that returns a Lua
  iterator for a Python object and adds the 0-based index to each
  item.

* new helper function ``python.iterex()`` in Lua that returns a Lua
  iterator for a Python object and unpacks any tuples that the
  iterator yields.

* new helper function ``python.iter()`` in Lua that returns a Lua
  iterator for a Python object.

* reestablished the ``python.as_function()`` helper function for Lua
  code as it can be needed in cases where Lua cannot determine how to
  run a Python function.


0.16 (2010-09-03)
-----------------

* dropped ``python.as_function()`` helper function for Lua as all
  Python objects are callable from Lua now (potentially raising a
  ``TypeError`` at call time if they are not callable)

* fix regression in 0.13 and later where ordinary Lua functions failed
  to print due to an accidentally used meta table

  metatable

  specify the Python object protocol used by Lua indexing when
  wrapping Python objects in Python code

* new helper functions ``python.as_attrgetter()``,
  ``python.as_itemgetter()`` and ``python.as_function()`` to specify
  the Python object protocol used by Lua indexing of Python objects in
  Lua code

* item and attribute access for Python objects from Lua code

-----------------

* fix Lua stack leak during table iteration

  inside of Lua
